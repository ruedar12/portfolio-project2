  <h3 class="important">My Backround</h3>
  <p>I have had about 4 total jobs, as mentioned before i currently work at a warehouse with my brother. He was iniitially hired first then referenced me for a job. Before i started working there i had worked at Carls Jr, Cafe Yumm, and Best Buy. Restaurants arent my thing thats something i really didnt enjoy. As for Best Buy it was a good job nothing to complain about but i was just a seasonal worker. I graduated from highschool in 2019. I did a little bit of College, i went to Portland Community College up until i was introduced to Epicodus. I was really unsure of what career i wanted to persue until my brother introduced me to Computer Science. He talked with a co-worker of ours that does front end stuff for our job. Our co-worker introduced my brother to Epicodus because he attended Epicodus and graduated from here. Then my brother talked to me about it and i looked further into it and just within 2 months i became a student here.</p>
  <h3 class="important">My Projects</h3>
  <p>With just beginning my career into Computer Science at Epicodus, here are some of the projects i have made so far.</p>
  <ol>
    <li>One of my first projects that Epicodus guided me through is hello-world. I was guided through this project with a lesson theres not much to it because it was my very first time making a webpage. This is only HTML.</li>
